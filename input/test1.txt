Nobody wants to fail. Perhaps then, that is why many avoid the unknown. When nothing is concrete, the ever present voice of doubt and fear grows ever louder. However, while venturing into the unknown, with the possibility of failure or disappointment, is scary, the unknown is also an avenue for extraordinary personal growth and innovation.
To begin, the idea of exploring the unknown for personal growth can be seen in most everyday activities. In order to reach one’s full potential, one must journey into the unknown to face challenges and experience new things. In my own life, I’ve grown much as a person by venturing into the unknown. I moved three times to five different schools, and every time I had to start from scratch. I didn’t know how things would turn out, I didn’t know anyone or anything. Yet, by embracing rather than hiding from all of these unknowns, I’ve learned how to adapt, communicate, socialize, and have met some of the best people I know. The risks of the unknown scared me, but if I hadn’t taken those risks, I wouldn’t have reaped the rewards and would be a vastly different person today. For others, college represents a similar opportunity. College is a completely new and foreign environment, full of strangers and unfamiliar surroundings. As a result, college not only enhances one’s academic prowess, but also represents a fresh start – an opportunity to journey into the unknown and discover oneself, learning new things and meeting new people. Without going to college, the opportunity of learning how to become fully independent and carve out a meaningful and satisfying life is lost. Not going to college, not journeying into the unknown, cripples one from reaching their full potential. Overall, experiencing the unknown is an invaluable opportunity for personal growth, being perhaps the single most important avenue for self improvement.
Next, the unknown is also needed for innovation, driving technological and scientific developments all throughout history. Take Elon Musk for example. In the early 2000s, Musk had two failing companies in Tesla and SpaceX. Driven to near bankruptcy, Musk took a massive risk and ventured into the unknown, dumping all the money he had into his projects with no promise of success. He pushed the limits of technology, making revolutionary advancements in rocket science and electric vehicles. Elon Musk’s venture into the unknown led him to become the world’s richest man by 2022, with a net worth over 300 billion dollars. If Musk had followed Anne Morrow Lindbergh’s suggestion in Gift from the Sea and “[not chosen] the unknown,” he never would’ve pushed himself to his own personal limits, nor pushed his employees to their limits, to achieve the success he realizes today. Musk’s story is not an isolated case. Similarly, despite being fired from his own company and nearly reaching bankruptcy, Steve Jobs invented the smartphone: a revolutionary item that has become the most iconic and important technological development of the twenty-first century. The unknown has its risks, but the unknown is needed for the progression of humanity, pushing innovation forward into the future.
In conclusion, the unknown, by its very nature, is scary. The possibility for failure, disappointment, harm, are all vivid. However, people must not bow before the mere possibility of failure and embrace the unknown instead. To take the risk, to not be complacent. The unknown represents the future, full of possible success, innovation, and experiences. Without the unknown, one's full potential may never be realized. Without the unknown, innovation is impossible. The risks of the unknown are an inherent and necessary part of progression.
